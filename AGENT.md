# Agent Log

## Context
- Goal: migrate FastFiRSt to Rust using Apache DataFusion/Ballista while
  maintaining compatibility with the original FLASH outputs.
- Current focus: standalone Rust CLI that mirrors the FLASH lowercase-overhang
  behaviour.

## Snapshot (2024-09-26)
- Implemented FASTQ parser, reverse-complement logic, overlap scoring, and
  merged-read generation in Rust.
- CLI reproduces FLASH outputs exactly for `input1.fq`/`input2.fq` test pair.
- Docs: `README.md` describes build/use; this log summarises progress.

## Pending
- Extend CLI tests/automation if needed.
- Plan integration with DataFusion/Ballista pipeline in upcoming steps.
